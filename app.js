        <RichTextBlock> Welcome Friend - to my sincere but abstract abode! <br /><br />
        
        Here lies the product of my labor, from my public web work and projects, to my inner mind in regards to the art of code and games and self.

    For what reason do you honor me with such a visit? Perhaps you’re an employer evaluating my records to see if I fit the bill, or perhaps a guest who has come across my works and would like to see more. Either way, you’re what makes this all matter, and I hope you find something of interest in your exploration of my domain. 

    A bit about me.

    My name is Jesse Bergerstock, and in the virtual worlds I go by illMadeCoder (Ill Made Coder). For like the Ill-Made Knight of Arthurian Legend, I value high expectations, but to never forget my humbling nature as man. In this way, my journey is of self growth and sincerity, I see no meaning in a life as a shadow of oneself; I find this role to be my greatest strength and greatest weakness. I live for the discovery and interaction with truths.

    <br /> <br /> But let’s back up, so what do I do?

    First I learn and model, second I create, third I appreciate. That doesn’t say all that much, but that’s what I do. Usually this takes form in the the study of self, maths, music, competition, astronomy, games, processes (programming), and ... well you get the point. But if you’re here, you’re likely here for my programmatic works, so then may I lean your vision towards the top left to see my web work, or perhaps below where some of my ideas on games or coding can be found, or finally, the top right to see everything else. If you find anything interesting, I’d love to know; you can always send me an email at illMadeCoder@gmail.com !

    There’s so much more to say, but I must limit myself somewhere, so instead you’ll have to discovery the rest through my work, or you can always drop me a message, but be warned - I’ll never shutup once you do.

    <br /> <br /> Please, enjoy your visit. </RichTextBlock>
